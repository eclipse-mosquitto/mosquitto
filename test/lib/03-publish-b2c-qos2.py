# Test whether a client responds correctly to a PUBLISH with QoS 1.

# The client should connect to port 1888 with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id publish-qos2-test
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK the client should verify that rc==0.
# The test will send the client a PUBLISH message with topic
# "pub/qos2/receive", payload of "message", QoS=2 and mid=13423. The client
# should handle this as per the spec by sending a PUBREC message.
# The test will not respond to the first PUBREC message, so the client must
# resend the PUBREC message with dup=1. Note that to keep test durations low, a
# message retry timeout of less than 10 seconds is required for this test.
# On receiving the second PUBREC with dup==1, the test will send the correct
# PUBREL message. The client should respond to this with the correct PUBCOMP
# message and then exit with return code=0.
