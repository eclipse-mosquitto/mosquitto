		<para>
			Specifies the type of private key in use when making TLS
			connections. This can be "pem", "engine", or "uri". This parameter is
			useful when a TPM module is being used and the private key has been
			created with it. Defaults to "pem", which means normal private key
			files are used.
		</para>
		<para>
			The "engine" option allows private keys operations via an OpenSSL engine.
			The "uri" option is available with OpenSSL 3.0 or later, and allows
			keys to be referenced through OpenSSL provider URIs such as pkcs11: URIs.
